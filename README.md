### Hello there ðŸ‘‹


**ðŸŒ±  Currently**:
* [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) & [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) Computer Science PhD Student, currently at the [Explainable Machine Learning Group](https://eml-unitue.de/people) (University of Tuebingen). Supervisors: [Zeynep Akata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQl9RtkAAAAJ) & [Oriol Vinyals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NkzyCvUAAAAJ&hl=de).

**ðŸŒ±  Previously**:
* Research Scientist Intern at [Meta AI with Diane Bouchacourt, Pascal Vincent and Mark Ibrahim](https://meta.com), Paris working on disentangled and out-of-distribution representation learning.
* Research intern at [Amazon AWS Tuebingen with Peter Gehler, Thomas Brox and Bernhard Schoelkopf](https://www.amazon.science/) on Industrial Anomaly Detection.
* Research intern at [Vector with Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi](http://www.marzyehghassemi.com/) on Visual Similarity and Deep Metric Learning. 
* Research intern at [Mila with Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen and Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/) on Large-Scale Medical Representation Learning, Contrastive and Deep Metric Learning.


ðŸ¤” Most of my current work focuses on multimodal & contrastive representation learning as well as out-of-distribution generalization, with particular interests in zero- and few-shot learning.
